# Kiriakulova-Module-1-Challenge

## Description

- This project was created on the basis of already existing code.  
- The main goal was optimization for search engines.  This is necessary in order for search engines to recognize all parts of the web page as well as possible, and then it will be easier for customers to find the business website.  
- To do this, semantic elements were added throughout the web page and `alt` attribute was added to the image tags.  Some minor bugs in the entire code were also fixed and CSS was consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure - to make it easier to work with this code in the future.
